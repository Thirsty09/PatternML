# A Simple Pattern Recognition Neuron

> A neuron will have a 3 inputs **no more, no less**.

> The neuron as implemented will have 1 output, but this can be modified.

## Training
> It is preferrable for the inputs to be arrays(Lists) where trends can be recognised and categorised.
> Sample outputs are fed to the neuron for comparison.

## Output
> Recognised trends in the data are returned.
> Sample data and outputs are real numbers.


# Note: This program has only one neuron.
